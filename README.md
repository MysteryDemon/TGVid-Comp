# What's The Extra In This Repo And Why This Repo🤔
● In these days [Railway](railway.app) banning many Repo on the basis of the requirements of the Repo,Railway started doing that because many people broke their terms of use they deploy illegal stuffs.

● As all knows that Railway has much better speed of compressing video in compare to other free service like heroku 

● That's why I edited Real Repo and make it deployable to railway again And also remove some useless Emoji because I hate emoji 😉.
